POSITIVES : 

1. Stuck together as a team in time of minor crisis.
2. Had a good atmosphere


NEGATIVES :

1. Didn't give a lot of thought to electing an able Project Manager. Performance suffered as a reason.
2. Didn't follow up quite as often as we would have liked.

Things to do differently next time : 

1. Make sure every step is properly planned out.
